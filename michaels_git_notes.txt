git clone
	clone an existing repository to current directory
git init
	start a new repository in current directory (all folders in directory will become a new repository)

Initialization
==============
git push --set-upstream https://github.com/kolten/casino-royale.git master
	This sets your upstream to the repository we are working with so that git push and git fetch by themselves do not require arguments. This is saved into what is called your upstream.

Updating yourself
=================
Avoid git pull. Use git fetch then git merge instead, unless you absolutely need to git pull to update existing files. When you don't add a URL it defaults to your upstream.
git pull
	fetch and merge
git fetch
	obtain new files from the repository
cd C:/casino-royale
	change folder to work directory
git status
	status update
git fetch
	fetch from last fetched repository (head)



Push your changes to repository
===============================
git add .
	add all untracked or changed files to repository
git commit -m "I added X."
	creates a new tracking node on the repository. overwrites old commits.
git push 
	uploads the latest commit
