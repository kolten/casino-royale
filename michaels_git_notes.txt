git clone
	clone an existing repository to current directory
git init
	start a new repository in current directory (all folders in directory will become a new repository)

Initialization
==============
git push --set-upstream https://github.com/kolten/casino-royale.git master
	This sets your upstream to the repository we are working with so that git push and git fetch by themselves do not require arguments.

Updating yourself
=================
Do not use git pull. Use git fetch then git merge instead, unless you absolutely need to git pull to existing files.

cd C:/casino-royale
	change folder to work directory
git status
	status update
git fetch
	fetch from last fetched repository (head)



Push your changes to repository
===============================
git add .
	add all untracked or changed files to repository
git commit -m "I added X."
	creates a new tracking node on the repository. overwrites old commits.
git push 
	uploads the latest commit
