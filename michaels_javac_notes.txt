Using Javac

If you need to try something out for a larger project and don't have any proper build tools nearby, you can always use a small trick that javac offers: the classnames to compile can be specified in a file. You simply have to pass the name of the file to javac with the @ prefix.

If you can create a list of all the *.java files in your project, it's easy:


# Linux
$ find -name "*.java" > sources.txt
$ javac @sources.txt

:: Windows
dir cr/bjp cr/bjd cr/snooper *.java > sources.txt
javac @sources.txt



The advantage is that is is a quick and easy solution.
The drawback is that you have to regenerate the sources.txt file each time you create a new source or rename an existing one file which is an easy to forget (thus error-prone) and tiresome task.
