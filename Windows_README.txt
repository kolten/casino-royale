This readme describes how to compile and run group 2 and 4's Casino-Royale project.

This system was developed using JRE 1.8.
This system requires that OpenSplice must installed in the C:\HDE\... directory.
This system requires that environment variables be set up correctly.
To do this, run release.bat located in \HDE\x86_64.win64\.

To compile the program, run BUILD_java_EDIT.bat located in \casino-royale\standalone.

To run a player, run RUN_PlayerMain.bat located in \casino-royale\standalone.

To run a dealer, run RUN_DealerMain.bat located in \casino-royale\standalone.

The above three batch scripts contain all the necessary classpaths and arguments.
